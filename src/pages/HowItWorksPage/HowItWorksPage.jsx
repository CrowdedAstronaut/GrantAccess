        <h1>The Problem:</h1>
        <p>Environment Remediation is the process of removing pollution or contaminants from water 
both groundwater and surface water, reclamation of abandoned mine lands, plugging of orphan wells, superfund site cleanup, and brownfields requiring rehabilitation. Urban and rural communities throughout the country are continuously being affected by waste pollutants. Enviromental radiation reduces harmful radiation exposure to people, and the environment to ionizing radiation.
